# Bar30 Pressure Sensor

Arduino software library is available [here](http://github.com/bluerobotics/BlueRobotics_MS5837_Library/).

The schematic and board layout are designed in EagleCAD.

# Hardware

## Description

The Bar30 pressure sensor is a high-pressure, high-resolution pressure sensor that is sealed from the water and ready to install in a watertight enclosure. With 0.2 bar resolution, it has an amazing depth measurement resolution of 2mm in the water column!

The sensor is the Measurement Specialties MS5837-30BA, which can measure up to 30 bar (300m depth) and communicates over I2C. Weâ€™ve added level switching circuitry so that it can operate on both 3.3V and 5V I2C lines. It comes standard with a 4-pin DF13 connector and compatible with most DroneCode compatible boards including the APM2.6, PixHawk, and others.

## Features

* Measure up to 300m water depth with 2mm resolution
* Reverse polarity protection
* 5V tolerant circuitry
* Standard DF13 connector for connection to DroneCode boards such as APM, PixHawk, Navio2, etc.
